The converted markdown is Recently, Iu2019ve noticed an interesting parallelism between impressionism and certain movies that Iu2019ve watched. Iu2019d like to share this nugget of information which may or may not be a result of u2728 confirmation bias u2728.

Impressionism
----------

Impressionism was an art movement in the latter half of the 19th century that focused on naturalistic subjects, light and capturing people in the moment. The wide globule-like brush strokes are an identifying feature of this form.

[

<img alt="" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1bdec75-aaee-4f4e-9037-1f1323bdc5c0_1299x2000.jpeg" height="2000" width="1299" />

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1bdec75-aaee-4f4e-9037-1f1323bdc5c0_1299x2000.jpeg)

The 2 things that I want to highlight about Impressionism that will be handy for the movies are :

1. **Naturalistic or Historical Subjects** - the Impressionists focused on painting subjects of the real world or some historical event. They refrained from painting mythological or phantasmagoric scenery and chose to zone on the individual and their environments.

2. **Zoom-out-to-zoom-in** - A key quality of many impressionistic pieces is that they require you to zoom out. When you look closely at a Monet or a Degas, its so messy. You see the brush strokes (*a big no-no for Renaissance artists*) and itu2019s muddled and almost like the artist was not focused. *So looking closely you get confused about what its about.* But the real magic is comes when you step back. You need to see it in its completeness. *Only upon seeing the whole do you understand the details. Hence, zoom-out-to-zoom-in.*

For example, in the Rouen Cathedral picture above, looking closely at it makes you think that a child found some oil colours and went ham. But zooming out, you can kind of see the cathedral shimmering in the sun. Like when you squint your eyes on a sunny day and the picture gets all hazy.

In the very same way, I think if you squint really hard. Like really, really hard after watching the following movies. You might just see it.

The Flicks
----------

Iu2019ve managed to isolate 2 movies that display this kind of style.

1. Aftersun

2. Babylon

These two, in my mind, best depict the connection. However there are plenty more.

#### Aftersun ####

This is the debut feature film of director Charlotte Wells and it got nominated for an Oscar. First. Feature. Film. Talk about come out swinging. This is the perfect example of u201Cnaturalistic subjectu201D. We all have memories. We reminisce. We get a lump in our throat looking back at old pictures. Aftersun is a movie that perfectly captures this. But I would argue you donu2019t fully realize it until the end.

This movie piqued my interested the first time I watched it. And it was heartbreaking the second time. You really have to watch the film end-to-end to grasp what itu2019s trying to convey. Watching pieces of it would only render parts of a whole. The very essence of impressionism - *zoom-out-to-zoom-in*.

#### Babylon ####

For all its gaudy excesses and glamour (and trust me, there was *a lot of it* uD83DuDC40), Babylon was an exceptional film.

[

However, when you take the movie as a whole, it is quite a gripping exposition about the cinema as a form. The cycles that any art form goes through. What new auters bring and what newer audiences take away.

This is an exceptional display of *zoom-out-to-zoom-in*. Up close, Babylon is a haphazard and frantic. You are bombarded with scene after scene of some narrative arc but have no idea what fits in where. However, when you watch the whole movie as a whole, it all comes together. Not only the story but also what Damien Chazelle wanted to convey - eternal cycles.

---

Anyway that has been my (*incredibly short*) take on a special kind of movie-art connection Iu2019ve found. I can think of a few other movies that have this style if you want to keep exploring

* In the Mood for Love

* Momento

please do let me know if you find more.

until next time.

To me, the song reflects how weu2019ve become so fattened by the comfort of stagnation, of domesticity, of consumerism that we forget about our struggle for meaning. </p><p>I had chosen that path before.

I could give an impromptu hour-long presentation on how some of his works have really cut me. Not because of the aesthetics or the cinematography or the composition <em>(although I could probably talk for an hour about that)</em>. But because of what the stories mean to me. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a perfect example here. </p><p>Iu2019d like to believe that the resolution for Mr. Fox was in realizing what really mattered was the people he had and not his daring stunts or unmatched cunning. Of course, heu2019d always be the quote-unquote Fantastic Mr. Fox, but that does not make him who <em>he</em> is. And so it goes with life. In our struggle to be more and our attempts to outwit our Bogus, Bunce and Bean, we forget that sometimes it comes to no more than being present. </p><p>I had to learn that being present is not a resignation of ambition. That being at peace is not a trait of a loser. Perhaps those who can bear an ordinary life without agony or remorse, are in fact truly <em>fantastic.</em> I understand now that even though we may live in a sewer, perhaps raising your juice boxes and celebrating the 5 and a half most amazing animals we know can be the most valuable experience we have. </p><p>Somehow the collective today has lost the capacity to fathom the contendedness of the ordinary.

No one but Samwise Gamgee rescued him. In life, I believe we all need a Samwise Gamgee. Maybe even a Faramir. But most importantly, the will to go on. All this uncertainity has helped me mull things over and has distilled some key lessons I thought would be worthwhile. </p><p></p><h4><strong>Life defined as a configuration of values</strong>.</h4><p>At some point in our lives, we all wish we could see an oracle. Hopefully, an old black woman who would tell us not to worry about knocking over a vase and say u201CKnow Thyselfu201D <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUN1ClT9i9w&amp;pp=ygUXdGhlIG9yYWNsZSBzY2VuZSBtYXRyaXg%3D\">while she bakes cookies</a>. Someone to tell us exactly what we need to hear. In trying to look for this oracle myself, I had a profound realization through a conversation with my friend Ansh from <a href=\"https://substack.com/@thesecondedit\">The Second Edit</a>. Our oracles are our values. Our switchboard of values. The little knobs that we twist and turn throughout our life to configure our decisions. Everyone has these, yet very few see them.</p><p>We all virtually live the same lives (structurally, at least). What differs is our values. To look past a decision to see the outcome is to look inward and parse your values. Do you want to take that job ? Ask that girl out ? Make time for this hobby ? Trade fulfillment for money ? That switchboard you have has decided. Can you see it ? The hard part is always seeing that switchboard. What do <em>you </em>want to do ? What matters to you ? Why ? These might pull back the curtain and help you see.</p><p>Through some hard won struggles, I discovered that life, god, the universe, whatever you believe in - it does not give you anything you want, but it does give you everything you need. Itu2019s up to you to make the struggle worthwhile.<strong> </strong>Holding onto this switchboard is the best way to do so, as I see it.</p><p></p><h4><strong>The answer is not a hut in the woods</strong>. </h4><p>Thoreau and McCandless could afford the ultimate bucolic escape but we partakers and slaves of the societal contract cannot. Even if we could, would it be worthwhile? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg7Zit2Thks&amp;pp=ygUPZmlzaCBvY2VhbiBzb3Vs\">Are we the fish so disappointed with water, that we crave the ocean</a>? The only utopias we have are the ones we lost. The concept of being at peace ONLY when you have the hut in the woods is simply fairy dust. Iu2019ve found that the only peace we get is the one we make with ourselves. As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nav.al/peace-motion\">Naval Ravikant would say</a>,&nbsp;u201CPeace is happiness at rest; happiness is peace in motion.u201D To be happy is being at peace while you pursue an activity. To not wish yourself elsewhere, happier. Somehow less anchored. Somehow less troubled. Somehow alleviated.</p><p>Being trampled by work, frazzled by social life and end up busy for its own sake. Or. Living perfectly in harmony with nature, having leisure time and being aloof. The answer is neither if not done with intention, with deliberation. Thoreau, I believe, wanted believe people to understand that happiness comes when you are at peace with yourself, your household and live in harmony with your pupose. Not simply by skipping along and smelling the roses.</p><p>Only in the case when you live without intention, without deliberation, without heed to the self are you unsuccessful. Be that living as a farmer or a CEO.</p><blockquote><p>In short, I am convinced, both by faith and by experience, that to maintain oneu2019s self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime, if we live simply and wisely. </p><p>- Henry David Thoreau</p></blockquote><p></p><h4><strong>The poison of self-bullshit</strong>.</h4><p>As John Varvaeke would define it in his podcast series <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Lhl51bZQlM8?si=wf5X99BtT3BAnxkq\">The Meaning Crisis</a> u201CSee bullshit, unlike lying, works by making you disinterested, unconcerned with whether what is being said is true.u201D Self-bullshit is to repeatedly make yourself unconcerned with the truth. To fool yourself and then forget that youu2019ve been fooling yourself. </p><p>Lying to others, evading blame, being petty - none of these sins comes close to the sin of bullshitting yourself. Because it is infinitely harder to cure. Why ? Since <strong>all</strong> the effort is internal. You have AA meetings for addiction, interventions for compulsive behaviours, and reconciliations for past grievances. But nobody can throw you a rope when you bullshit yourself. You are both redeemer and redeemed. It takes more than just initiative to change the path you walk on. Reinforcement and faith are the walking sticks you have to cultivate. Reinforcement that you are being true to that switchboard of values. Faith that your struggles will be worthwhile so long as you stay true.</p><p></p><h4><strong>Mediocrity is not a sin</strong></h4><p>We all collectively decided that not constantly hustling for that next promotion, that next interview or somehow not being busy is a sign of the incompetent, the loser, the ones with no hand to play.</p><p>Whether they tend to their garden or close million dollar deals, the true aristocrats, the glimmering stars are the ones who have discovered tranquility within themselves. The true captains of their heart. Their contended u201Cmediocritiesu201D are immune to the snickers and sordid stares of those who may cling to the hamster wheel. Perhaps it is those who live ordinary lives, true to themselves and their household that deserve the utmost praise and the highest of honours. </p><p>In the end, the only shame of being unsuccessful in life is being unsuccessful in living you how want to, the best you can.</p><p></p><h4>To gaze upon a soul</h4><p>Being on a path where I know better what I want is no reason to look down upon those who donu2019t yet know. I am not superior in intellect or wiser or more adept at life than those who might still be struggling in the wheel. </p><p>I remind myself that my strength comes from knowing I live deliberately. To be at peace with this. Swimming against the tide of social expectations and cultural norms will be a perilous journey. This does not make me exceptional or deserving. Only lucky. Lucky to have realized these truths. Self-discovery is self-effacement.</p><blockquote><p>And he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light</p><p>- Plato, <em>The Republic</em></p></blockquote><p>And so should there be a time when I look upon someone whose soul is blinded, I ask myself how it is they have come to be this way, and to reach out, without expectation or assurance, and offer to walk the darkness together. </p><p></p><p>With these lessons, I ask again - what are we holding onto ?</p><blockquote><p>That there is some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

What do I want to do with my life ?

This year was pivotal in answering this question. For me, it has been one where I learned to reframe my view of a meaningful life. A life u201Cwell-livedu201D.

This piece is an exploration and a reflection of what Will Hunting's search for purpose has taught me about the hamster wheel I found myself in. And why the lessons from the movie and life have led to a reconception of self, destiny, and the pursuit of happiness.

The Hedonic Treadmill
----------

In a study conducted on 22 lottery winners, the average self-reported levels of hapiness 6 month after winning the lottery were no more than the a control group. [Some were even unhappier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juO4zxsjSjw) than they had been before winning. The euphoria of a new car, a new house, a fancy vaction fizzles out when they manifest into reality. You are still yourself.

The hedonic adaptation is our coping mechanism to maintain an emotional equilibrium. The pursuit of new, shiny atoms is worthwhile because we are convinced it will bring us hapiness. And then we get there. Days, weeks and months go by and *Alas!* *Tragedy strikes!* The Magic Mirror on the wall tells us there newer, fairer, shinier atoms to pursue and oh no, these atoms youu2019ve acquired just wonu2019t do. IT HAS TO BE THOSE ONES THAT ARE THE KEY TO YOUR HAPINESS.

This hamster wheel ensnares everyone. A life defined as the list of checkboxes. I realized this was what I was living.

So what is the hedonic treadmill? [Rona Wang](https://rona.substack.com/p/sellouts-conundrum) put it better that I ever could, u201COften, I would walk along the same street, music tucked in my ears, footsteps meandering as if I had somewhere to go, but somehow never ending up anywhere at all.u201D

The remedy I believe starts with being brutally honest with yourself. There is this scene in Good Will Hunting towards the end, where Sean asks Will what he wants to do.

I think about this a lot. How many times have I conjured bullshit answers? The bullshit answer for everybody. The snark rebuttal to the double edged u201CWhat do you want to dou201D? How many times have I lied to myself? What do *I* want to do? A lifetime filled with knowledge yet I cannot give myself a straight answer.

What do I want to do? What would it take to escape this hamster wheel?

The Shoulders of Giants
----------

u201CIf I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giantsu201D, said Newton. And I know now what he meant.

Iu2019ll be honest here. I wouldnu2019t have appreciated the work of Thoreau if not for Dead Poetu2019s Society. u201CTo suck out all the marrow of lifeu201D. u201CCarpe diemu201D. Emerson, Thoreau and the rest of the transcendentalists bubbled to the top of my reading list once I finished the movie.

Trying to live in the way I saw those around me live was crippling. To worship the green bible. Cali or bust. Dude, you *need* a FAANG company on your resume. Gotta grind more Leetcode. LinkedIn manhunts. Gradually, these burdens dug into me and I ended up puking it all out physically. Anxiety attacks are a mean way to find out youu2019re not who youu2019re pretending to be.

Through experiences, conversations, more experiences and more conversations, I came to a sort of revelation. **I did not wish to lie in my bed at 80, decrepit and tired, only then to realize that I had wasted my life trying to live someone elseu2019s.** Like Thoreau said u201CRather than love, than money, than fame, give me truthu201D, I decided to rid myself of all the lies and excesses. To give myself truth. u201CTo live deliberately and to front only the essential facts of lifeu201D.

And then I asked myself, what do *you* want to do ?

Pink Floydu2019s vitriolic *Wish You Were Here* album was both an outcry and a lament. Outcry against the forces of a faceless, barren corporate machine and lamentation over their lost friend Syd Barrett, whose excessive use of LSD and later schizophrenia compromised his mental faculties. He became the diamond that never got to shine.

These themes come together in the albumu2019s namesake song, which has been one of my all-time favourites. u201C*Wish You Were Here*u201D refers not specifically to Syd, but to everyone who has failed to make that leap and be free of the mental constraints of your imposed u201Ccomfort zoneu201D, and that they are truly absent. To me, the song reflects how weu2019ve become so fattened by the comfort of stagnation, of domesticity, of consumerism that we forget about our struggle for meaning.

I had chosen that path before. To play a lead role in a cage. To run after those interviews, those names on my resume, those shiny badges and barter blind achievement for something essential to meu2014curiosity.

And so I asked myself, what do *you* want to do ?

Wes Anderson man. I could give an impromptu hour-long presentation on how some of his works have really cut me. Not because of the aesthetics or the cinematography or the composition *(although I could probably talk for an hour about that)*. But because of what the stories mean to me. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a perfect example here.

Iu2019d like to believe that the resolution for Mr. Fox was in realizing what really mattered was the people he had and not his daring stunts or unmatched cunning. Of course, heu2019d always be the quote-unquote Fantastic Mr. Fox, but that does not make him who *he* is. And so it goes with life. In our struggle to be more and our attempts to outwit our Bogus, Bunce and Bean, we forget that sometimes it comes to no more than being present.

I had to learn that being present is not a resignation of ambition. That being at peace is not a trait of a loser. Perhaps those who can bear an ordinary life without agony or remorse, are in fact truly *fantastic.* I understand now that even though we may live in a sewer, perhaps raising your juice boxes and celebrating the 5 and a half most amazing animals we know can be the most valuable experience we have.

Somehow the collective today has lost the capacity to fathom the contendedness of the ordinary. I think the remedy to this amnesia must come from the individual.

And once more, I asked myself, what do *you* want to do ?

What are we holding onto, Sam?
----------

The Prince of Peace stumbled and fell on the road to Mount Doom. No one but Samwise Gamgee rescued him. In life, I believe we all need a Samwise Gamgee. Maybe even a Faramir. But most importantly, the will to go on. All this uncertainity has helped me mull things over and has distilled some key lessons I thought would be worthwhile.

#### **Life defined as a configuration of values**. ####

At some point in our lives, we all wish we could see an oracle. Hopefully, an old black woman who would tell us not to worry about knocking over a vase and say u201CKnow Thyselfu201D [while she bakes cookies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUN1ClT9i9w&pp=ygUXdGhlIG9yYWNsZSBzY2VuZSBtYXRyaXg%3D). Someone to tell us exactly what we need to hear. In trying to look for this oracle myself, I had a profound realization through a conversation with my friend Ansh from [The Second Edit](https://substack.com/@thesecondedit). Our oracles are our values. Our switchboard of values. The little knobs that we twist and turn throughout our life to configure our decisions. Everyone has these, yet very few see them.

We all virtually live the same lives (structurally, at least). What differs is our values. To look past a decision to see the outcome is to look inward and parse your values. Do you want to take that job ? Ask that girl out ? Make time for this hobby ? Trade fulfillment for money ? That switchboard you have has decided. Can you see it ? The hard part is always seeing that switchboard. What do *you* want to do ? What matters to you ? Why ? These might pull back the curtain and help you see.

Through some hard won struggles, I discovered that life, god, the universe, whatever you believe in - it does not give you anything you want, but it does give you everything you need. Itu2019s up to you to make the struggle worthwhile. Holding onto this switchboard is the best way to do so, as I see it.

#### **The answer is not a hut in the woods**.  ####

Thoreau and McCandless could afford the ultimate bucolic escape but we partakers and slaves of the societal contract cannot. Even if we could, would it be worthwhile? [Are we the fish so disappointed with water, that we crave the ocean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg7Zit2Thks&pp=ygUPZmlzaCBvY2VhbiBzb3Vs)? The only utopias we have are the ones we lost. The concept of being at peace ONLY when you have the hut in the woods is simply fairy dust. Iu2019ve found that the only peace we get is the one we make with ourselves. As [Naval Ravikant would say](https://nav.al/peace-motion), u201CPeace is happiness at rest; happiness is peace in motion.u201D To be happy is being at peace while you pursue an activity. To not wish yourself elsewhere, happier. Somehow less anchored. Somehow less troubled. Somehow alleviated.

Being trampled by work, frazzled by social life and end up busy for its own sake. Or. Living perfectly in harmony with nature, having leisure time and being aloof. The answer is neither if not done with intention, with deliberation. Thoreau, I believe, wanted believe people to understand that happiness comes when you are at peace with yourself, your household and live in harmony with your pupose. Not simply by skipping along and smelling the roses.

Only in the case when you live without intention, without deliberation, without heed to the self are you unsuccessful. Be that living as a farmer or a CEO.

>

> \- Henry David Thoreau

#### **The poison of self-bullshit**. ####

As John Varvaeke would define it in his podcast series [The Meaning Crisis](https://youtu.be/Lhl51bZQlM8?si=wf5X99BtT3BAnxkq) u201CSee bullshit, unlike lying, works by making you disinterested, unconcerned with whether what is being said is true.u201D Self-bullshit is to repeatedly make yourself unconcerned with the truth. To fool yourself and then forget that youu2019ve been fooling yourself.

Lying to others, evading blame, being petty - none of these sins comes close to the sin of bullshitting yourself. Because it is infinitely harder to cure. Why ? Since **all** the effort is internal. You have AA meetings for addiction, interventions for compulsive behaviours, and reconciliations for past grievances. But nobody can throw you a rope when you bullshit yourself. You are both redeemer and redeemed. It takes more than just initiative to change the path you walk on. Reinforcement and faith are the walking sticks you have to cultivate. Reinforcement that you are being true to that switchboard of values. Faith that your struggles will be worthwhile so long as you stay true.

#### **Mediocrity is not a sin** ####

We all collectively decided that not constantly hustling for that next promotion, that next interview or somehow not being busy is a sign of the incompetent, the loser, the ones with no hand to play.

Whether they tend to their garden or close million dollar deals, the true aristocrats, the glimmering stars are the ones who have discovered tranquility within themselves. The true captains of their heart. Their contended u201Cmediocritiesu201D are immune to the snickers and sordid stares of those who may cling to the hamster wheel. Perhaps it is those who live ordinary lives, true to themselves and their household that deserve the utmost praise and the highest of honours.

In the end, the only shame of being unsuccessful in life is being unsuccessful in living you how want to, the best you can.

#### To gaze upon a soul ####

Being on a path where I know better what I want is no reason to look down upon those who donu2019t yet know. I am not superior in intellect or wiser or more adept at life than those who might still be struggling in the wheel.

I remind myself that my strength comes from knowing I live deliberately. To be at peace with this. Swimming against the tide of social expectations and cultural norms will be a perilous journey. This does not make me exceptional or deserving. Only lucky. Lucky to have realized these truths. Self-discovery is self-effacement.

>
>
> And he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light
>
>
>
> \- Plato, *The Republic*
>
>

And so should there be a time when I look upon someone whose soul is blinded, I ask myself how it is they have come to be this way, and to reach out, without expectation or assurance, and offer to walk the darkness together.

With these lessons, I ask again - what are we holding onto ?

But the question is whether or not youu2019re perfect for each other. Thatu2019s the whole deal.
----------

In my short time here on our blue ball in the void, Iu2019ve found no sweeter place to return than this scene in Good Will Hunting. The one where Sean shares that his wife farts in her sleep.

Iu2019ve learned that this girl - she can be a new job, a new experience, a new hobby, (maybe even an *actual* girl) whatever you find via your switchboard. She wonu2019t be perfect.

What are some of the arguments they make in this regard ? </strong></p><p></p><p>In his essay, <em><a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2021/03/il-maestro-federico-fellini-martin-scorsese/\">Il Maestro</a></em>, Martin Scorsese argued that cinema and the corresponding viewing experience is being devalued to the lowest common denominator <em>u201Ccontentu201D. </em></p><blockquote><p>u201CContentu201D became a business term for all moving images: a David Lean movie, a cat video, a Super Bowl commercial, a superhero sequel, a series episode. It was linked, of course, not to the theatrical experience but to home viewing, on the streaming platforms that have come to overtake the moviegoing experience, just as Amazon overtook physical stores.</p><p>- Martin Scorsese, u2018Il Maestrou2019</p></blockquote><p>Using Federico Felliniu2019s (his idolu2019s) works as the trail, he guides us onto a path towards a greater understanding of storytelling through cinema. His claim is modern cinematic atmosphere is being depleted of innovative, standalone, unique stories that exist in and of themselves. In his eyes, powerful cinema is becoming rarer as the viewers (and consequently theatres) steer toward more anodyne, cursory sequences of moving stills that are fed to them instead of discovered. </p><p>Infamously, Scorsese said that the Marvel movies werenu2019t u201Ccinemau201D. He later clarified that this wasnu2019t meant to be a slight, and he respects the artists who work on these projects. He only meant that these movies which follow a common trope and are made to fit into a cinematic universe do not count as u201Ca cinematic experienceu201D. Ridley Scott, Denis Villeneuve and Quentin Tarantino have all had similar criticisms of the state of cinema currently.  </p><p>Keep in mind, Scorsese is no Luddite. He does not blindly shout back in the face of change. Heu2019s embraced change several times during his long careeru2014digital cameras, streaming services, etc. So for him to be adamant about this means that these qualms are deep-rooted for him.</p><p></p><p>Susan Sontag wrote in her essay u2018<em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/25/magazine/the-decay-of-cinema.html\">The Decay of Cinema</a>u2019</em> wrote that cinephilia had come under attack and that we as a generation no longer have a characteristic love of movies that defined the decades that came before us.</p><blockquote><p>But you hardly find anymore, at least among the young, the distinctive cinephilic love of movies that is not simply love of but a certain taste in films (grounded in<br>a vast appetite for seeing and reseeing as much as possible of cinemau2019s glorious past).</p><p>- Susan Sontag, u2018The Decay of Cinemau2019</p></blockquote><p>A lot of factors have led to this vanished love of cinema. She claims that movies are reduced to assaultive images with faster and faster cut times that donu2019t demand someoneu2019s attention.  </p><p>Her essay was written in 1996 but feels particularly relevant today. Think back. When was the last time you went to the cinema to watch an indie film? Or how many times do you actively seek to watch a movie rather than endlessly scrolling on Netflix for SOMETHING TO PASS AS PASSIVE ENTERTAINMENT. When have you gone to the cinema for another other than a big blockbuster movie or thriller sequel (or god forbid some Fast and Furious movie, GOD, WHEN WILL THEY STOP THOSE).  </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefc4038f-a03b-4012-b76c-189ba69bcad3_1280x534.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefc4038f-a03b-4012-b76c-189ba69bcad3_1280x534.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefc4038f-a03b-4012-b76c-189ba69bcad3_1280x534.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefc4038f-a03b-4012-b76c-189ba69bcad3_1280x534.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefc4038f-a03b-4012-b76c-189ba69bcad3_1280x534.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefc4038f-a03b-4012-b76c-189ba69bcad3_1280x534.jpeg\" width=\"728\" height=\"303.7125\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/efc4038f-a03b-4012-b76c-189ba69bcad3_1280x534.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:534,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:151158,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefc4038f-a03b-4012-b76c-189ba69bcad3_1280x534.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefc4038f-a03b-4012-b76c-189ba69bcad3_1280x534.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefc4038f-a03b-4012-b76c-189ba69bcad3_1280x534.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefc4038f-a03b-4012-b76c-189ba69bcad3_1280x534.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 \"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>My point is<em>u2014Cinema and cinephilia are in decline. The rapturous love of cinema and storytelling has faded. It is now being replaced by content. We have come under attack.</em></p><p>Our generationsu2019 Paul Reveres are shouting out their cry of alarm.  </p><h2>The Rift</h2><blockquote><p>We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real?\"</p><p>- Guy Montag, <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> </p></blockquote><p><strong>Is there a foundational difference between art and content ? If there has always been a tug-of-war between cinema for industry and cinema for art, why the tantrum now ?</strong></p><p></p><p>Based on the essays of Sontag and Scorsese and my personal experiences, I want to give 2 reasons for why I made that claim above:</p><h4>1. Content is Transactional. Art is a Gift. </h4><p>In his article <a href=\"https://thomasjbevan.substack.com/p/content-versus-art\">Content v Art</a>, Thomas Bevan argues that content is a transactional product. The impluse is the same as advertising. It is looking for something <em>from you</em>. Not necessarily monetary. They can be transactions of time as well. </p><blockquote><p>Content is simply an informercial for itself, for its creator, perpetually and forever. Which is why content binges bring about this vague unease and sensation of being trapped in a mirrored maze where you and your chosen content guru are shouting affirmations at your own refracted and distorted reflections.</p></blockquote><p>Art on the other hand is equivalent to the nature of gift-giving. An artist distils themselves, their experience and perspective into a piece of work that is offered to the bystander. The bystander more often than not has no expectation of what they will encounter when experiecing it for the first time. Just like unwrapping a gift. </p><p>The objective of this distinction is not to draw a line in the sand but to help you understand my current view of the state of visual culture. I see it as content masquerading as art. We have become so burnt on this landslide of content that our acuity can no longer help us make the difference between whatu2019s worth watching and whatu2019s worth experiencing. A subtle but valuable distinction. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e6f905-4b1b-4def-b688-305694685744_1024x1024.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e6f905-4b1b-4def-b688-305694685744_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e6f905-4b1b-4def-b688-305694685744_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e6f905-4b1b-4def-b688-305694685744_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e6f905-4b1b-4def-b688-305694685744_1024x1024.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e6f905-4b1b-4def-b688-305694685744_1024x1024.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e3e6f905-4b1b-4def-b688-305694685744_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1904937,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e6f905-4b1b-4def-b688-305694685744_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e6f905-4b1b-4def-b688-305694685744_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e6f905-4b1b-4def-b688-305694685744_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3e6f905-4b1b-4def-b688-305694685744_1024x1024.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 \"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><h4>2. The Blurring of Cinema and Visual Content</h4><p>Past the turn of the millennia, I believe that the line between cinema and visual content has become blurred, with each seeping into the otheru2019s territory. We are subconsciously unable to distinguish between the forms of media that we consume, and thus dilute it all down to the same thing u2013 u201Ccontentu201D. The technological state of the world have made it the perfect breeding ground to allow this dilution. Why ?</p><p><strong>Echo-chamber algorithms</strong> u2013 The u2018Relatedu2019 tab. Ah, the hallmark of the modern viewing experience. It is ubiquitous. YouTube. Netflix. Prime. Amazon. Google. UberEats. If it provides you with a service, it probably has a u2018Relatedu2019 tab. We live in the perfect time for these algorithms to take shape. The oodles of data out there coupled with the long arm of corporate greed have devised algorithms to make us stay on the platform as long as possible. The content is designed to be use-and-throw material for the brain. Watch a reel, chuckle, scroll - oh another reel just like the ones before. In such fashion, the u2018Relatedu2019 tab has inhibited our ability to explore and discover and serves to feed us what we <em>might </em>like to stay on as long as possible. </p><p><strong>A Pedestrian viewing experience</strong> u2013 With the mobile phone and the laptop increasingly becoming peopleu2019s primary option to view movies, it devalues the magic that films provide. Since we view almost all our visual content on these devices, we subconsciously associate a movie as another piece of visual content. Watching a movie becomes like watching a long reel. Hit Play. Oh, a notification. Iu2019ll get back to the flick in a second. Dang, another memo, letu2019s get to this and then go back. Phew, finally back, letu2019s continue. Awwwww shit, I had to send that mail u2026u2026 The film is no longer an all-encompassing experience. Cinema cannot be truly enjoyed when you cannot be filled by it. A phone or a laptop can never be conducive for watching. </p><p></p><p>Since now movie theatres are shifting to primarily running u2018safeu2019 movie options, the cinematic experience has been commodified and sold out. This coupled with the viewers indulgence in the contentified visual experience leaves little room for the exploration of movies that u201Ccolour outside the linesu201D. </p><p>Perhaps Sontag could say it better than I ever could </p><blockquote><p>The sheer ubiquity of moving images has steadily undermined the standards people once had both for cinema as art and for cinema as popular entertainment.</p><p>- Susan Sontag</p></blockquote><p></p><h2>The Metamorphosis</h2><p><strong>How does this impact cinema, really ? Doesnu2019t art change ? Why should it be different this time around ? </strong></p><p></p><p>Throughout our cultural history, not only do forms of artistic expression evolve, but also their position in our society. </p><p>Painting was seen as a means to capture reality or vivid stories. From the cave paintings in Africa by ancient cave dwellers to Waterlilies by Monet, we have time and time again managed to conjugate our perception of reality into paint, pixel or porcelain and share it through that medium. </p><p>Painting and the fine arts became our way of understanding this world and passing it on as a succinct visual story. There was nothing better. </p><p>But then along came the commercially accessible photograph in the mid 1800s. Suddenly there was a far less painstaking and far quicker way of capturing reality. The photograph could capture as much detail as a painting could. Consequently, the fine arts were relieved of their duty to express realistic stories. They were soon unleashed upon the unseen, the unspokenu2014the u201Cunrealu201D. </p><p>Take a look at u2018The School of Athensu2019 by Raphael from the 16th century. </p><div

The converted markdown is This article is an examination of cinemau2019s supposed decline as a cultural and creative force past the turn of the millennia. Instead of blatantly proclaiming streaming services as cinemau2019s nemesis, I want to have a more insightful look at the evolution of cinema as an art and comment on the dilution of visual culture to content.

My focus here will be to examine several claims by great cinema auteurs about cinemau2019s decline. I will move further to discuss the evolution of cinema as an art form and contrast how the modern state of media consumption has corralled it.

Thanks for reading cinePLOTTED. Kindly read the whole article and if you feel it was worth your time, please subscribe.

```
So through the night rode Paul Revere;  
And so through the night went his cry of alarm  
To every Middlesex village and farm, u2014  
A cry of defiance, and not of fear,

u2014 Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, u201CPaul Revere's Rideu201D
```

**Why do so many auteurs and intellectuals deride the current state of visual media culture ? What are some of the arguments they make in this regard ?**

In his essay, *[Il Maestro](https://harpers.org/archive/2021/03/il-maestro-federico-fellini-martin-scorsese/)*, Martin Scorsese argued that cinema and the corresponding viewing experience is being devalued to the lowest common denominator *u201Ccontentu201D.*

>
>
> u201CContentu201D became a business term for all moving images: a David Lean movie, a cat video, a Super Bowl commercial, a superhero sequel, a series episode. It was linked, of course, not to the theatrical experience but to home viewing, on the streaming platforms that have come to overtake the moviegoing experience, just as Amazon overtook physical stores.
>
>
>
> \- Martin Scorsese, u2018Il Maestrou2019
>
>

Using Federico Felliniu2019s (his idolu2019s) works as the trail, he guides us onto a path towards a greater understanding of storytelling through cinema. His claim is modern cinematic atmosphere is being depleted of innovative, standalone, unique stories that exist in and of themselves. In his eyes, powerful cinema is becoming rarer as the viewers (and consequently theatres) steer toward more anodyne, cursory sequences of moving stills that are fed to them instead of discovered.

Infamously, Scorsese said that the Marvel movies werenu2019t u201Ccinemau201D. He later clarified that this wasnu2019t meant to be a slight, and he respects the artists who work on these projects. He only meant that these movies which follow a common trope and are made to fit into a cinematic universe do not count as u201Ca cinematic experienceu201D. Ridley Scott, Denis Villeneuve and Quentin Tarantino have all had similar criticisms of the state of cinema currently.

Keep in mind, Scorsese is no Luddite. He does not blindly shout back in the face of change. Heu2019s embraced change several times during his long careeru2014digital cameras, streaming services, etc. So for him to be adamant about this means that these qualms are deep-rooted for him.

Susan Sontag wrote in her essay u2018*[The Decay of Cinema](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/25/magazine/the-decay-of-cinema.html)u2019* wrote that cinephilia had come under attack and that we as a generation no longer have a characteristic love of movies that defined the decades that came before us.

>
>
> But you hardly find anymore, at least among the young, the distinctive cinephilic love of movies that is not simply love of but a certain taste in films (grounded in  
> a vast appetite for seeing and reseeing as much as possible of cinemau2019s glorious past).
>
>
>
> \- Susan Sontag, u2018The Decay of Cinemau2019
>
>

A lot of factors have led to this vanished love of cinema. She claims that movies are reduced to assaultive images with faster and faster cut times that donu2019t demand someoneu2019s attention.

Her essay was written in 1996 but feels particularly relevant today. Think back. When was the last time you went to the cinema to watch an indie film? Or how many times do you actively seek to watch a movie rather than endlessly scrolling on Netflix for SOMETHING TO PASS AS PASSIVE ENTERTAINMENT. When have you gone to the cinema for another other than a big blockbuster movie or thriller sequel (or god forbid some Fast and Furious movie, GOD, WHEN WILL THEY STOP THOSE).

My point is*u2014Cinema and cinephilia are in decline. The rapturous love of cinema and storytelling has faded. It is now being replaced by content. We have come under attack.*

Our generationsu2019 Paul Reveres are shouting out their cry of alarm.

The Rift

**Is there a foundational difference between art and content ? If there has always been a tug-of-war between cinema for industry and cinema for art, why the tantrum now ?**

Based on the essays of Sontag and Scorsese and my personal experiences, I want to give 2 reasons for why I made that claim above:

#### 1. Content is Transactional. Art is a Gift.  ####

In his article [Content v Art](https://thomasjbevan.substack.com/p/content-versus-art), Thomas Bevan argues that content is a transactional product. The impluse is the same as advertising. It is looking for something *from you*. Not necessarily monetary. They can be transactions of time as well.

>
>
> Content is simply an informercial for itself, for its creator, perpetually and forever. Which is why content binges bring about this vague unease and sensation of being trapped in a mirrored maze where you and your chosen content guru are shouting affirmations at your own refracted and distorted reflections.
>
>

Art on the other hand is equivalent to the nature of gift-giving. An artist distils themselves, their experience and perspective into a piece of work that is offered to the bystander. The bystander more often than not has no expectation of what they will encounter when experiecing it for the first time. Just like unwrapping a gift.

The objective of this distinction is not to draw a line in the sand but to help you understand my current view of the state of visual culture. I see it as content masquerading as art. We have become so burnt on this landslide of content that our acuity can no longer help us make the difference between whatu2019s worth watching and whatu2019s worth experiencing. A subtle but valuable distinction.

#### 2. The Blurring of Cinema and Visual Content ####

Past the turn of the millennia, I believe that the line between cinema and visual content has become blurred, with each seeping into the otheru2019s territory. We are subconsciously unable to distinguish between the forms of media that we consume, and thus dilute it all down to the same thing u2013 u201Ccontentu201D. The technological state of the world have made it the perfect breeding ground to allow this dilution. Why ?

**Echo-chamber algorithms** u2013 The u2018Relatedu2019 tab. Ah, the hallmark of the modern viewing experience. It is ubiquitous. YouTube. Netflix. Prime. Amazon. Google. UberEats. If it provides you with a service, it probably has a u2018Relatedu2019 tab. We live in the perfect time for these algorithms to take shape. The oodles of data out there coupled with the long arm of corporate greed have devised algorithms to make us stay on the platform as long as possible. The content is designed to be use-and-throw material for the brain. Watch a reel, chuckle, scroll - oh another reel just like the ones before. In such fashion, the u2018Relatedu2019 tab has inhibited our ability to explore and discover and serves to feed us what we *might* like to stay on as long as possible.

**A Pedestrian viewing experience** u2013 With the mobile phone and the laptop increasingly becoming peopleu2019s primary option to view movies, it devalues the magic that films provide. Since we view almost all our visual content on these devices, we subconsciously associate a movie as another piece of visual content. Watching a movie becomes like watching a long reel. Hit Play. Oh, a notification. Iu2019ll get back to the flick in a second. Dang, another memo, letu2019s get to this and then go back. Phew, finally back, letu2019s continue. Awwwww shit, I had to send that mail u2026u2026 The film is no longer an all-encompassing experience. Cinema cannot be truly enjoyed when you cannot be filled by it. A phone or a laptop can never be conducive for watching.

Since now movie theatres are shifting to primarily running u2018safeu2019 movie options, the cinematic experience has been commodified and sold out. This coupled with the viewers indulgence in the contentified visual experience leaves little room for the exploration of movies that u201Ccolour outside the linesu201D.

Perhaps Sontag could say it better than I ever could

The Metamorphosis
----------

**How does this impact cinema, really ? Doesnu2019t art change ? Why should it be different this time around ?**

Throughout our cultural history, not only do forms of artistic expression evolve, but also their position in our society.

Painting was seen as a means to capture reality or vivid stories. From the cave paintings in Africa by ancient cave dwellers to Waterlilies by Monet, we have time and time again managed to conjugate our perception of reality into paint, pixel or porcelain and share it through that medium.

Painting and the fine arts became our way of understanding this world and passing it on as a succinct visual story. There was nothing better.

But then along came the commercially accessible photograph in the mid 1800s. Suddenly there was a far less painstaking and far quicker way of capturing reality. The photograph could capture as much detail as a painting could. Consequently, the fine arts were relieved of their duty to express realistic stories. They were soon unleashed upon the unseen, the unspokenu2014the u201Cunrealu201D.

Take a look at u2018The School of Athensu2019 by Raphael from the 16th century.

Abstract Expressionism, Cubism and Surrealism were art movements born out of the liberation from the need to capture reality. They explored terrains unseen. Paintings assumed a fundamentally different role in the realm of human expression.

Once again, in the wake of the mass-market video camera, the photograph was relieved of its duty to capture what the eye saw. Videos served that role now. The video became our default mode of experiencing a slice of someoneu2019s view of reality. The photograph now represented something different. A great photograph was viewed as a unique artistic expression. The freezing of time on a film. Reality stuck in a tiny square.

Similarly, **I think cinemau2019s position in society is changing**. It used to be the perfect escape. An unspoken communal agreement to be enveloped by music and machine. Exclusive and surreal. But now, it is becoming something different. **I believe content is to cinema what video is to the photograph**. Content now is our tiny, free and quick mode to be wrapped up in another reality. Cinema will become something else. Perhaps this is the cocoon stage. I donu2019t know when the butterfly will come.

**Where do you, the reader, stand amidst all of these changes ? What is your mission, should you choose to accept it ?**

I claimed that cinema and cinephilia have faded. But I also said that it they are underrgoing a change. A cocoon stage if you will. Now this is not all doom and gloom because you dear reader have great agency amidst this whole change.

I want to inspire believe to u201Cdiscoveru201D cinema again. None of this will stop or break the capitalist commodification of cinema, but it might just rekindle the joy of unwrapping the gift of art.

I firmly believe that movies are the closest we will ever get to dreaming awake. And this is uniquely valuable. It is the great liberator. The *Lisan-al-Gaib*. It is both powerful and subtle. It can lead to not only great revelations but also quiet introspection. The ability to forget the world and your problems for those 2 hours in a dark room is almost hallucinogenic.

But it is on the cusp of a radical change in its position in society. The illness it suffers from is pernicious but not fatal. Debilitating but not incurable.

My remedy for it lies in the agency of you - the reader. Talk to your friends about an imaginative movie that you saw. Have conversations with your cinephile friends about finding these diamonds in the rough, and see what they say about it. Make use of a spirited soul instead of an anodyne algorithm to expand your culture repertoire. Help curate a collective love of visual culture. If you donu2019t have u201Ccinephiliacsu201D in your milieu (I suggest you get some :P) or if you want to diversify your tastes, use resources like [MUBI](https://mubi.com/) and [The Criterion Channel](https://www.criterionchannel.com/) to curate your appreciation for great cinema. Go to your local indie theatre semi-regularly. Go to the cinema when they do a re-run or show classics / iconic movies.

Let me reiterate, I am not protesting watching movies of a cinematic universe or rewatching guilty pleasures. Anyone who knows me knows my deep love of Star Wars, Denis Villeneuve and Old Pixar. My protest is against an algorithm and a like button tunnelling your mind. My protest is against a notification bell breaking through the entrancement of a scene. My protest is against the mindless scrolling for *something* to remind you of a sound and sight. The remedy I believe is a cure to these.

Most of all however, remember to share. I want more people to have discourse about movies and the beauty they carry. Never forget

Few are acclaimed. Even fewer are u201Cevergreenu201D. These evergreen ones are the true gems that we hold onto u2013 not as an individual, but as a people. Cultural landmarks that have a place beyond time and space. Just as Samwise Gamgee says in <em>The Two Towers,</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why.</em></p></blockquote><p>Putting aside my corny attempt at a title, this post is an appreciation and analysis of the film style of a creator whose resume cements his name in anyoneu2019s Top 10 Directors of all Time. Francis Ford Coppola. </p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://keanemoraes.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thanks for reading cinePLOTTED!

Not many directors can tout this. More than just accolades, he has been a driving force for the industry, inspiring and mentoring many like George Lucas and Martin Scorsese. </p><p>Furthermore, Coppola is a huge risk-taker. He will rediscover himself and take huge risks on stories he is adamant on telling. <em>Apocalypse Now,</em> as you will soon see, was a logistical nightmare and Coppola had to personally fund a good portion of it. For FFC, art is risk. Risk involves laying yourself bare and being unapologetically expressive. You hear him say it himself in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKY6SDDtRKA\">an interview with GQ</a></p><blockquote><p>Subsequently, other movies I made that I didnu2019t know how to make, I came to learn how to make them in the course of doing it, which is how I, is my peculiar approach to cinema. I like to learn by not knowing how to do it.</p></blockquote><p>Michael Donnelly of theScriptLab eloquently articulates this point in <a href=\"https://thescriptlab.com/features/screenwriting-101/3335-francis-ford-coppola-a-most-personal-journey/\">his article on Coppola</a></p><blockquote><p>Through his films, Coppola faces that which produces his greatest angst. His fears of failure, of death and his willingness to lay bare his uneasiness with them are what endear him to audiences who share similar emotions. </p></blockquote><p><em>The Conversation</em>, which is FFCu2019s most cherished and personal projects, is another example of the directoru2019s unrelenting resolve to bet on himself. Even after the success and the fame that the Godfather brought, FFC would work to reinvent his style and narratives.</p><p>Enough talk now, letu2019s see the movies u2026</p><h3>SPOILER ALERT: THIS POST WILL SPOIL THE FOLLOWING MOVIES:</h3><ol><li><p>The Godfather</p></li><li><p>The Godfather Part II</p></li><li><p>Apocalypse Now</p></li></ol><p><strong>IF YOU HAVENu2019T WATCHED THESE MOVIES.

This means that the once this point has passed, the characters are all sucked into a whirlwind from which they cannot alight.

A central character has a radical shift in perspective, and the rest are now placed into ever-evolving stakes or rapidly deteriorating circumstances. </p><p>As an audience member, the violence and drama of this scene catalyzes oneu2019s interest in the narrative and engenders the fear of the consequences. Now we want to know what happens to Michael. What happens to the Corleone family ? Is it war ? Are they going to go in hiding ? From now on, YOU MUST stick to the end to remedy the suspense of drama. Another core midpoint use ticked off. Ensnare the audience. </p><p>FFC would say in the GQ interview</p><blockquote><p>There was in there sort of latent idea of a classical, almost Shakespearean story of about great king who had three sons and needed to choose one to succeed him.

Not many sequels can be as prolific as the first. More often than not, the sequel will ride the coat-tails of the original and rehash the story. It is a tough task when the first was successful. It is almost insurmountable when the first is <em>The Godfather</em>. </p><p>Yet somehow Coppola pulled it off.

from the same time period, I think Coppola put these in to show the isolation that comes inevitably from the acquisition of power.

We will never come close to the atrocities of war, and yet we can be so touched by it. </p><p>This movie was especially difficult to make for Coppola. Once again, he threw himself at the movie without any idea about how to make it. There were innumerable logistical problems that arose from shooting in the jungle. Sheenu2019s deteriorating health also postponed production and really tested the mettle and sanity of Coppola as a storyteller and a filmmaker. As Michael Donnelly of the theScriptLab notes</p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the turmoil around its production was drastic as logistics were continually problematic, as production budgets swelled, as Sheenu2019s health suffered and as Coppola struggled to write the ending. His wife would remark that he had approached the brink of insanity while theorizing that the increasingly troubled filmmaker had to u201Cfail a little, die a little, go insane a little, to come out the other side.u201D</p></blockquote><p></p><p><strong>What could be the midpoint in this movie ?</strong> </p><p>This time, the midpoint is rather early on. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png\" width=\"1329\" height=\"680\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:680,&quot;width&quot;:1329,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:816966,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 \"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Lt. Colonel Kilgore bombs and incinerates an entire village just so he could see if the waves are u201Csurfableu201D. In his platoon, one of the men claimed that waves were 6ft high, so Kilgore decided to surf them for himself and took Lance with him.  </p><p>This really changes Capt. Willardu2019s perspective of the war. The midpoint is not an u201Cactionableu201D midpoint wherein the elements of the scene or the plot change but the change with a characteru2019s mind. The cauldron of his mind boils and the preaching of Col. Kurtz seem to be exemplified by the actions of the officers in the Vietnam War. </p><blockquote><p>They train young men to drop fire on people. But their commanders won't allow them to write 'fuck' on their airplanes because it is obscene.</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps Willard understands that Kurtz was a prophet. Someone who saw through the masquerade of morality and humane platitudes bandied about by the invader. How can you call yourself humane and ethical when you firebomb civilians ? When you massacre a generation for your ulterior motive ? You call yourself the liberator and yet you stomp upon those who you wish to liberate ?

The converted markdown is Many movies are mediocre. Few are acclaimed. Even fewer are u201Cevergreenu201D. These evergreen ones are the true gems that we hold onto u2013 not as an individual, but as a people. Cultural landmarks that have a place beyond time and space. Just as Samwise Gamgee says in *The Two Towers,*

Putting aside my corny attempt at a title, this post is an appreciation and analysis of the film style of a creator whose resume cements his name in anyoneu2019s Top 10 Directors of all Time. Francis Ford Coppola.

### Why Coppola? ###

FFC has 3 movies under his belt that are arguably considered u201Cevergreenu201D *u2013 The Godfather, The Godfather Part II* and *Apocalypse Now*. Not many directors can tout this. More than just accolades, he has been a driving force for the industry, inspiring and mentoring many like George Lucas and Martin Scorsese.

Furthermore, Coppola is a huge risk-taker. He will rediscover himself and take huge risks on stories he is adamant on telling. *Apocalypse Now,* as you will soon see, was a logistical nightmare and Coppola had to personally fund a good portion of it. For FFC, art is risk. Risk involves laying yourself bare and being unapologetically expressive. You hear him say it himself in [an interview with GQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKY6SDDtRKA)

>
>
> Subsequently, other movies I made that I didnu2019t know how to make, I came to learn how to make them in the course of doing it, which is how I, is my peculiar approach to cinema. I like to learn by not knowing how to do it.
>
>

Michael Donnelly of theScriptLab eloquently articulates this point in [his article on Coppola](https://thescriptlab.com/features/screenwriting-101/3335-francis-ford-coppola-a-most-personal-journey/)

>
>
> Through his films, Coppola faces that which produces his greatest angst. His fears of failure, of death and his willingness to lay bare his uneasiness with them are what endear him to audiences who share similar emotions.
>
>

*The Conversation*, which is FFCu2019s most cherished and personal projects, is another example of the directoru2019s unrelenting resolve to bet on himself. Even after the success and the fame that the Godfather brought, FFC would work to reinvent his style and narratives.

Enough talk now, letu2019s see the movies u2026

### Whatu2019s new ? ###

Today I want to examine these movies with Michael Haugeu2019s *[Six Stage Plot Structure](https://jamigold.com/2012/08/michael-hauges-workshop-making-emotional-journeys-and-external-plots-play-together/).* An illustration is provided below.

Midpoints signify the u201C**Point of No Returnu201D** as depicted above. This means that the once this point has passed, the characters are all sucked into a whirlwind from which they cannot alight. The information they have or the acts that are committed make it impossible to go back to things as they were before. This ideally takes place in the middle of a movieu2019s runtime, but can be shifted based on the screenwriteru2019s discretion.

I want to focus on midpoints and look at how Coppola handles them u2013 both to build stakes and to enthrall the audience. He does this superbly well. In my (admittedly limited) cinema knowledge, perhaps only Spielberg and PTA do this as well.

The Godfather
----------

The **midpoint of this movie** is the restaurant scene between Michael, Sollozzo and Captain McClusky. Specifically this moment -

[

<img alt="" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00c3fbad-6cde-4e40-b72e-b311c8c4c9ff_1384x866.png" height="866" width="1384" />

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00c3fbad-6cde-4e40-b72e-b311c8c4c9ff_1384x866.png)

Everything leading up to it shows Michaelu2019s disinterest in family affairs, but deep love for his family members. Following this, he becomes a pivotal part of the family business.

After this scene, none of the characters could go back to the way things were before. This is how a midpoint should be done. A central character has a radical shift in perspective, and the rest are now placed into ever-evolving stakes or rapidly deteriorating circumstances.

As an audience member, the violence and drama of this scene catalyzes oneu2019s interest in the narrative and engenders the fear of the consequences. Now we want to know what happens to Michael. What happens to the Corleone family ? Is it war ? Are they going to go in hiding ? From now on, YOU MUST stick to the end to remedy the suspense of drama. Another core midpoint use ticked off. Ensnare the audience.

FFC would say in the GQ interview

>
>
> There was in there sort of latent idea of a classical, almost Shakespearean story of about great king who had three sons and needed to choose one to succeed him. So I think it was that political analysis and story of power and its succession that made the film more weighty and interesting.
>
>

The Godfather Part II
----------

It is an unspoken precept in Hollywood that a sequel can never be as good as the original. Not many sequels can be as prolific as the first. More often than not, the sequel will ride the coat-tails of the original and rehash the story. It is a tough task when the first was successful. It is almost insurmountable when the first is *The Godfather*.

Yet somehow Coppola pulled it off. A masterpiece of Shakespearean scale that to this day has people debating over which is better.

What is the **midpoint here** ?

Arguably in two locations, not too far apart

The Godfather Part II is about expanding and the perils and risks that come with it. After both the scenes depicted above, the main characters in the movie can never go back to how things were before.

Once more, this is **NOT THE CLIMAX**, rather the first domino that sets off the rest. u201CThe Point of No Returnu201D. Michaelu2019s actions in the latter half of the movie are entirely determined by the consequences of these two scenes. Furthermore, the theme of isolation can be traced back to stem from these two scenes. Michael becomes increasingly isolated as the story plows forward.

Although these are two scenes from the same time period, I think Coppola put these in to show the isolation that comes inevitably from the acquisition of power. Michael's descent into darkness is a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked ambition and the cost of sacrificing one's own values and relationships for the sake of power.

Whou2019s left ?

Sonny. dead. Fredo. dead. Frankie. dead. Kay. gone. Tom. gone. No one left.

None.

Apocalypse Now
----------

One of those most audacious, gutsy and breathtaking movies that became a hallmark of war movies. Apocalypse Now. **If you havenu2019t watched it, please stop reading and watch it.** I would hate to ruin the awe of witnessing it for the first time.

The distant themes of violence of horror are almost palpable to us u2013 green skinned civilians who breathe carefree. We will never come close to the atrocities of war, and yet we can be so touched by it.

This movie was especially difficult to make for Coppola. Once again, he threw himself at the movie without any idea about how to make it. There were innumerable logistical problems that arose from shooting in the jungle. Sheenu2019s deteriorating health also postponed production and really tested the mettle and sanity of Coppola as a storyteller and a filmmaker. As Michael Donnelly of the theScriptLab notes

>
>
> Unfortunately, the turmoil around its production was drastic as logistics were continually problematic, as production budgets swelled, as Sheenu2019s health suffered and as Coppola struggled to write the ending. His wife would remark that he had approached the brink of insanity while theorizing that the increasingly troubled filmmaker had to u201Cfail a little, die a little, go insane a little, to come out the other side.u201D

**What could be the midpoint in this movie ?**

This time, the midpoint is rather early on.

<img alt="" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a32613-77bc-411f-bce4-86e59772b4ac_1329x680.png" height="680" width="1329" />

Lt. Colonel Kilgore bombs and incinerates an entire village just so he could see if the waves are u201Csurfableu201D. In his platoon, one of the men claimed that waves were 6ft high, so Kilgore decided to surf them for himself and took Lance with him.

This really changes Capt. Willardu2019s perspective of the war. The midpoint is not an u201Cactionableu201D midpoint wherein the elements of the scene or the plot change but the change with a characteru2019s mind. The cauldron of his mind boils and the preaching of Col. Kurtz seem to be exemplified by the actions of the officers in the Vietnam War.

> They train young men to drop fire on people. But their commanders won't allow them to write 'fuck' on their airplanes because it is obscene.

Perhaps Willard understands that Kurtz was a prophet. Someone who saw through the masquerade of morality and humane platitudes bandied about by the invader. How can you call yourself humane and ethical when you firebomb civilians ? When you massacre a generation for your ulterior motive ? You call yourself the liberator and yet you stomp upon those who you wish to liberate ? Kurtz was right.

>

You have to have men who are moral... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling... without passion... without judgment... without judgment!

Willard perhaps recognized this.

Perhaps not.

I plan to look into this matter further with under a more nuanced and informed lens. I hope to derive more knowledge from themes like this.

Takeaways
----------

Youu2019ve stuck with me this far. What do you want out of this read ?

Perhaps look at movies with a more critical lens.

* Where do the dominoes start to fall ?

* Who is in the crosshairs, and who pull the trigger ?

If someone told me this, I scoff in their face. Seriously, donu2019t do this. Enjoy a movie if you choose to. Donu2019t bear the burden of objective analysis.

See you next timeu2026.

The images not only stand out because of their stark illumination, but the events they portray also engender a gut-wrenching horror in the viewer. We will come back to this point later.</p><h4>Gritty Realism</h4><p>One final note. <strong>Caravaggiou2019s paintings depicted gritty and intense scenes</strong> either from the Bible or classical literature. He added grim realist details that made the scene all the more rivetingu2014dirt under fingernails, eyes in horror, bones protruding out the body, etc. In this context, his style suited his themes perfectly. The clarity, level of detail, and saturation of Caravaggiou2019s paintings were unrivalled when compared to paintings from the dark-ages and ancient history.</p><p>Unfortunately, 18th century neoclassical painters seriously got their panties in a bunch, decrying that Caravaggio u201Cset out to destroy art with his base realism.u201D And he fell out of favour for the next 200 years or so. However, Rembrandt and other Dutch Golden Age painters took inspiration from his work and integrated into their own.</p><p>Nowadays, Caravaggio is revered as the most modern one out of the old masters. Almost, an Alexander McQueen to the then world of Versace and Louis Vuitton. </p><h2>Chiaroscuro in Cinema</h2><p>320 years after Caravaggio turned chiaroscuro into an artistic style with his paintings, his influence is seen in an art form that we cherish todayu2014cinema. But when did the style jump from oil paintings to film reels ? </p><h4>German Expressionism</h4><p>Starting in the 1920s, German Expressionism was an art movement that emphasized depicting the artistu2019s inner whims and desires instead of portraying reality.  This had a profound effect on cinema, as you can see below. Sets in movies like u2018The Cabinet of Dr. Caligariu2019 were impossibly structured and had extreme camera tilts. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of light and shadow is used to create a surreal effect.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\"

notes</p><blockquote><p>Towards the end of the German expressionist movement, directors started implementing strong chiaroscuro lighting in <a href=\"https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-film-noir/\">film noirs</a>. </p><p>u2026</p><p>As filmmakers like Fritz Lang and cinematographer Karl Freund emigrated to the U.S., they brought their lighting style with them.</p></blockquote><p>Soon enough, this style became mainstream with film noir in the 40s and the work of Orson Welles' u2018Citizen Kaneu2019. </p><h4>Modern Cinema</h4><p>In modern cinema, cameras and video recorders are so advanced that they can capture depth just like a human eye does, and so watching the contrast of light and dark no longer serves to add another dimension to the scene. Instead, u201Cchiaroscurou201D shots and scenes are used to u2018colouru2019 the mood of a scene.  Often times, this lighting is used for scenes depicting some macabre sequence of events or to hint to a viewer that something is amiss. </p><p>Take a look for yourself u2026</p><div

Iu2019m going to isolate 2 directors and answer these questions. </p><h2>Snyderu2019s and Fincheru2019s Works</h2><p>David Fincher needs no introduction. He is one of Hollywoodu2019s most talented and ingenious directors. A real creative powerhouse. I could write several other blog posts describing his style, his methodology, his works and their cultural impact, but I will succinctly express my interpretation of his cinematographic style here.</p><p><strong>Just like Caravaggio, Fincheru2019s works deal somewhat gory and grim subjects.</strong> F***t C**b, Se7en, Gone Girl, etc. all are examples of spine-chilling experiences with equally indelible visuals. These works are rife with chiaroscuro lighting. Other works like Benjamin Button, The Social Network and Mank are less infused with this lighting technique. </p><p>Take a look.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a

Notice that in Se7en, itu2019s always raining until the end. Cold rain beating down on you. Cloudy weather to dampen your spirit. All of these play a part in telling the story. A good part of Fight Club is shot at night with dim lighting. </p><p>Look at the first image for Fight Clubu2014itu2019s almost a painting. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Zack Snyder is another director who makes fantastic movies. <strong>Once again, just like Caravaggio, he DOES NOT OMIT the grim, bloody details from his works.</strong> I have come to enjoy his works because he weaves in intricate details, seemingly minor, that only become apparent on multiple rewatches. I really wished he would have made more DC movie, but alas.</p><p>Now, regardless of how you view him as a director or how much you enjoy (or donu2019t enjoy) his works, it is good practice to learn something from the visuals. Snyder is known to darken the movie during post-production. Overall, he uses a darker colour grading, and it fits in with the movies he makes. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\"

The Origins of Chiaroscuro and Tenebroso
----------

#### Chiaroscuro ####

The word u201C*chiaroscuro*u201D comes from the combination of the Italian words *chiara* (light) and *oscuro* (dark). It is a style of painting that is characterized by:

* Clear tonal contrasts

* Defined light and dark regions to create depth

* Low-key lighting with soft light sources.

In the painting above, Caravaggio depicts Matthew, the tax collector, being called by Jesus to be his disciple. The drama in the scene is intensified by the stark contrast between the deep shadows, warm highlights and midtones. The light focuses your attention on the subjects seated at the tableu2014almost illuminating the viewer to the miracle at hand.

Who calls a tax collector to be a disciple ? Whatu2019s more interesting is that Matthew points to himself, almost to say, u201CWho ? Me ? Really ?u201D. The light coming through the windows is what furnishes the painting with depth. Notice that if it was a bright painting with multiple light sources, the element of depth is lost because of the flat background.

When dealing with chiaroscuro, try asking, u201Cwhat if I removed this? How does it impact the painting?u201D. Feel free to admire the painting further.

#### Tenebroso ####

*Tenebroso* is the Italian word for u201Cdark, gloomy and mysteriousu201D and it is the base of the English word u201Ctenebrismu201D a.k.a. dramatic illumination. It is a style of painting characterized by:

* Profound light and dark contrasts

* Dark backgrounds with illuminated subjects

* Singular light source that almost exclusively illuminates a scene.

Tenebrism adds another layer of depth and mood to the image. The images not only stand out because of their stark illumination, but the events they portray also engender a gut-wrenching horror in the viewer. We will come back to this point later.

#### Gritty Realism ####

One final note. **Caravaggiou2019s paintings depicted gritty and intense scenes** either from the Bible or classical literature. He added grim realist details that made the scene all the more rivetingu2014dirt under fingernails, eyes in horror, bones protruding out the body, etc. In this context, his style suited his themes perfectly. The clarity, level of detail, and saturation of Caravaggiou2019s paintings were unrivalled when compared to paintings from the dark-ages and ancient history.

Unfortunately, 18th century neoclassical painters seriously got their panties in a bunch, decrying that Caravaggio u201Cset out to destroy art with his base realism.u201D And he fell out of favour for the next 200 years or so. However, Rembrandt and other Dutch Golden Age painters took inspiration from his work and integrated into their own.

Nowadays, Caravaggio is revered as the most modern one out of the old masters. Almost, an Alexander McQueen to the then world of Versace and Louis Vuitton.

Chiaroscuro in Cinema
----------

320 years after Caravaggio turned chiaroscuro into an artistic style with his paintings, his influence is seen in an art form that we cherish todayu2014cinema. But when did the style jump from oil paintings to film reels ?

#### German Expressionism ####

Starting in the 1920s, German Expressionism was an art movement that emphasized depicting the artistu2019s inner whims and desires instead of portraying reality. This had a profound effect on cinema, as you can see below. Sets in movies like u2018The Cabinet of Dr. Caligariu2019 were impossibly structured and had extreme camera tilts. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of light and shadow is used to create a surreal effect.

This movement was largely attributed with revitalizing chiaroscuro lighting in film.

Chris Heckman of StudioBinder notes

>
>
> Towards the end of the German expressionist movement, directors started implementing strong chiaroscuro lighting in [film noirs](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-film-noir/).
>
>
>
> u2026
>
>
>
> As filmmakers like Fritz Lang and cinematographer Karl Freund emigrated to the U.S., they brought their lighting style with them.
>
>

Soon enough, this style became mainstream with film noir in the 40s and the work of Orson Welles' u2018Citizen Kaneu2019.

#### Modern Cinema ####

In modern cinema, cameras and video recorders are so advanced that they can capture depth just like a human eye does, and so watching the contrast of light and dark no longer serves to add another dimension to the scene. Instead, u201Cchiaroscurou201D shots and scenes are used to u2018colouru2019 the mood of a scene. Often times, this lighting is used for scenes depicting some macabre sequence of events or to hint to a viewer that something is amiss.

Take a look for yourself u2026

There are numerous other instances that I wish I could have added but for the sake of brevity, I did not. I highly encourage you, the reader, to watch the movies listed above. See when this lighting is used. Why? What purpose does it serve? Iu2019m going to isolate 2 directors and answer these questions.

Snyderu2019s and Fincheru2019s Works
----------

David Fincher needs no introduction. He is one of Hollywoodu2019s most talented and ingenious directors. A real creative powerhouse. I could write several other blog posts describing his style, his methodology, his works and their cultural impact, but I will succinctly express my interpretation of his cinematographic style here.

**Just like Caravaggio, Fincheru2019s works deal somewhat gory and grim subjects.** F\*\*\*t C\*\*b, Se7en, Gone Girl, etc. all are examples of spine-chilling experiences with equally indelible visuals. These works are rife with chiaroscuro lighting. Other works like Benjamin Button, The Social Network and Mank are less infused with this lighting technique.

Take a look.

Once again, there are plenty of other scenes that you can find, but I omitted them for this post. Notice that in Se7en, itu2019s always raining until the end. Cold rain beating down on you. Cloudy weather to dampen your spirit. All of these play a part in telling the story. A good part of Fight Club is shot at night with dim lighting.

Look at the first image for Fight Clubu2014itu2019s almost a painting.

Zack Snyder is another director who makes fantastic movies. **Once again, just like Caravaggio, he DOES NOT OMIT the grim, bloody details from his works.** I have come to enjoy his works because he weaves in intricate details, seemingly minor, that only become apparent on multiple rewatches. I really wished he would have made more DC movie, but alas.

Now, regardless of how you view him as a director or how much you enjoy (or donu2019t enjoy) his works, it is good practice to learn something from the visuals. Snyder is known to darken the movie during post-production. Overall, he uses a darker colour grading, and it fits in with the movies he makes.

300 is a great example of the u2018Caravaggismu2019 in his work. In so many other instances, he infuses the scene with unmistakable chiaroscuro lighting and adds sharp shadows and contrasts. 300 obviously has a gruesome and bloody plot, and the visual style that is seamlessly infused into the storyu2019s depiction emboldens the tone.

His DC flicks are quite iconic and ZSJL is nothing short of an epic. BvS deals with the conflict within Bruce and Supermanu2019s fall from grace, and both of these motifs get integrated using a dark, gory visual style. One that plays well with the message.

Actually, you will get to see what happens to his movies if the chiaroscuro style is cast aside u2026

See for yourself, eh?
----------

I want to do a side-by-side comparison of how lighting and especially this sharp contrast lighting changes the mood of a scene and even how the viewer thinks about how the characters are interacting.

Fortunately, I have the perfect movie comparison:

*Justice League vs. Zack Snyderu2019s Justice League.*

Now, regardless of you feel about the 2 movies, it would do us all some good to contrast how low-key lighting makes us feel about a scene. Hereu2019s what I want you to do:

1. For each image, PAUSE. STOP SCROLLING. LOOK INTENTLY AT IT (and the caption if you need some context). Memorize it.

2. Close your eyes.

3. Think about the imageu2014**What do you think the characters are saying to each other ? How are they saying it ? What can you surmise about the charactersu2019 emotions from this image ?**

4. Keep these answers in the back of your head before moving on.

#### NOW REFLECT u2026.  ####

What did you think ? If you found yourself indifferent, thatu2019s perfectly normalu2014some people are more moved with dialogue than visuals. Otherwise, if you felt that these scenes were qualitatively different in their mood, congratulations!!!! Youu2019ve come to understand the importance of lighting in movies. Now you can apply this new-found knowledge the next time you watch a flick.

Now you may understand why Snyder uses this visual style in his movies. It makes a subtle but non-negligible difference.

WWCD?
----------

When making a movie and need low-key lightingu2014ask yourself, u201CWhat Would Caravaggio Do ?u201D

Perhaps while story boarding, it would do you some good to blend this visual style into some scenes.

Scorsese famously spoke about Caravaggiou2019s influence on him as a film-maker in an interview

>
>
> You come upon the scene midway and you're immersed in it. It was different from the composition of the paintings that preceded it. It was like modern staging in film: it was so powerful and direct. **He would have been a great film-maker, there's no doubt about it.**
>
>
>
> u2026
>
>
>
> He sort of pervaded the entirety of the bar sequences in *Mean Streets*. He was there in the way I wanted the camera movement, the choice of how to stage a scene.
>
>

I guess what Iu2019m trying to get at is that this chiaroscuro lighting can be used from legendary directors to amateur artists. Caravaggiou2019s works pervade time and medium and we are all the better for it now.

Takeaways ?
----------

All the movies that I have clipped are specified in their respecitve captions. I encourage you to watch the movie once in its entirety and then watch it again with no dialogue. Donu2019t try and lip-read or turn on captions. Try seeing what the visuals can tell you about the sequence of events.

Until next timeu2026

A piece of visual culture that blends both of themu2014well, thatu2019s a truly spectacular viewing experience. </p><p>I am not bold enough to make a Youtube channel or a vlog, and donu2019t have enough experience or knowledge at this point in time to write a book. Not only does a blog allow me to track my growth and document it publicly, but it also pushes me to learn more about film and tease out meaning from scenes in movies. </p><p></p><h3>Whatu2019s more to come ? </h3><p>I hope to publish at least twice a month and explore the connections between some works of art (e.g. Caravaggiou2019s <em>u2018Calling of St. Michaelu2019, </em>JMW Turneru2019s<em> u2018The Slave Shipu2019, </em>etc.) and movies with beautiful images and subtle cinematography. </p><p>Occasionally, I will sprinkle in some of my own personal thoughts and takes on the cinematographers/directoru2019s visual perspective and other times, I will quote them to explain why the scene was structured in a particular way. </p><p></p><h2>What now ?</h2><p><strong>I would like to give you a sample of what I hope to achieve through this blog. </strong>Consider <strong>Blade Runner 2049</strong>. One of my favourites and one of (<em>psstu2026my favourite director</em>) Denis Villeneuveu2019s most stunning movies. Roger Deakins, perhaps the most renowned cinematographer of our generation, is the Director of Cinematography. Villenueve + Deakins have given us some absolute fantastic cinema manifested through Prisoner, Sicario and the movie of the houru2014Blade Runner 2049.  </p><p></p><h4>NO SPOILERS! DONu2019T WORRY. </h4><p></p><p>This movieu2019s overarching themes are about loneliness, isolation and, as an extension of the first Blade Runner, what it means to be human.</p><ul><li><p>What qualifies us to bestow upon ourselves these u201Cinalienable rightsu201D ? Does being born rather than being made give us a u201Csoulu201D ? </p></li><li><p>If there were another being that fit the qualifications aboveu2014would we bestow upon them the same inalienable rights ? Would it be in our best interest ? Would we be hypocrites if we didnu2019t ?</p></li></ul><p>These are hard questions to answer, and this movie taps into them to prompt the viewer to think about it.</p><p></p><h3>Pale Yellow</h3><p>This colour signifies <strong>slow and fragmented expositions </strong>in the movie. Almost every scene where we the viewer learn more about the story, the characters, their motives, etc. has hints of yellow or an overwhelming wash of yellow. Letu2019s see where.</p><p>Take for example at the start of the movie</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link is-viewable-img image2\" target=\"_blank\"

The converted markdown is Toto, I have a feeling weu2019re not in Kansas anymore!

Nope, I donu2019t think you are. Hello everyone! Iu2019m Keane. Iu2019m a university student who has a keen interest in film and cinematography. In addition to film, I am also learning about art and art history. Visual culture has enamoured me and I wish to share it with everyone else.

I started this blog to share a slice of my knowledge and perhaps some opinions with the world, and perhaps get a few more people to appreciate visual culture as well.

### Why a blog ?  ###

Over the years, I have come to find that films with beautiful imagery are a dime a dozen, however sublime and evocative cinematography in a film is a rare find. A piece of visual culture that blends both of themu2014well, thatu2019s a truly spectacular viewing experience.

I am not bold enough to make a Youtube channel or a vlog, and donu2019t have enough experience or knowledge at this point in time to write a book. Not only does a blog allow me to track my growth and document it publicly, but it also pushes me to learn more about film and tease out meaning from scenes in movies.

### Whatu2019s more to come ?  ###

I hope to publish at least twice a month and explore the connections between some works of art (e.g. Caravaggiou2019s *u2018Calling of St. Michaelu2019,* JMW Turneru2019s *u2018The Slave Shipu2019,* etc.) and movies with beautiful images and subtle cinematography.

Occasionally, I will sprinkle in some of my own personal thoughts and takes on the cinematographers/directoru2019s visual perspective and other times, I will quote them to explain why the scene was structured in a particular way.

What now ?
----------

**I would like to give you a sample of what I hope to achieve through this blog.** Consider **Blade Runner 2049**. One of my favourites and one of (*psstu2026my favourite director*) Denis Villeneuveu2019s most stunning movies. Roger Deakins, perhaps the most renowned cinematographer of our generation, is the Director of Cinematography. Villenueve + Deakins have given us some absolute fantastic cinema manifested through Prisoner, Sicario and the movie of the houru2014Blade Runner 2049.

#### NO SPOILERS! DONu2019T WORRY.  ####

This movieu2019s overarching themes are about loneliness, isolation and, as an extension of the first Blade Runner, what it means to be human.

* What qualifies us to bestow upon ourselves these u201Cinalienable rightsu201D ? Does being born rather than being made give us a u201Csoulu201D ?

* If there were another being that fit the qualifications aboveu2014would we bestow upon them the same inalienable rights ? Would it be in our best interest ? Would we be hypocrites if we didnu2019t ?

These are hard questions to answer, and this movie taps into them to prompt the viewer to think about it.

### Pale Yellow ###

This colour signifies **slow and fragmented expositions** in the movie. Almost every scene where we the viewer learn more about the story, the characters, their motives, etc. has hints of yellow or an overwhelming wash of yellow. Letu2019s see where.

Take for example at the start of the movie

This is one of the scenes where Officer K looks at the flower and finds out that it is in fact a marker for something. The flower is a key to the bigger picture.

This eerie scene with Niander Wallace, Luv and the new replicant model also presents and expounds upon the character of Niander Wallaceu2014his motives and personality. A ruthless businessman with no tolerance for excess. Someone who will stop at nothing to meet his goals. This is what we get out of this scene.

In Officer Ku2019s search for the truth, we see this wide data array with a mighty splash of yellow that floods our visuals. Another hint at an exposition scene. And we do in fact get more knowledge about the plot in the following scenes.

The above scene is Las Vegas is another crucial one where we get to know more about the child and how the secret was buried.  

### Bright White  ###

This colour is paired with **sharp and unexpected turns or revelations.**

These two scenes are quite obviously sharp turns centred around Luv. Once again, this may not be an overwhelming amount of white in the background, but it is bright and would certainly shock the viewer into attention.

This scene was one of the biggest u201CHOLLLLYYYYu2026..SHIIITTTu201D moments in the movie. Look aroundu2014itu2019s an assault of bright white colour. A jarring effect that forces you to pay attention to the events to follow.

One obvious counter-argument is that Ku2019s room is white.

But this is a mild white colour, and I am looking specifically at bright white colours.

### Soft Cool Pastels ###

The use of soft cool pastel colours is also to **invoke a sense of melancholy and distress.** These play into the themes of the movie, like isolation and solitude.

Itu2019s difficult to put how these scenes make you feel in isolation - itu2019s necessary to watch the movie in its entirety to truly grasp the depth of emotion displayed here (especially the first and last images). However, these bleached colours intermingling do impress the desolation and anguish that the protagonist feels. Try imagining these with a bright, sunny day (on some Off-World planet). It just wouldnu2019t feel right. It wouldnu2019t play into the narrative and emotional tone. This is why I emphasize the colour and background.

Thatu2019s all I wanted to say for today. I hope you enjoyed this and I hope you subscribe. If you agree with this breakdown, Iu2019m glad to hear it. If you disagree, then Iu2019m even more eager to hear your rebuttal.

Thank you for reading!
